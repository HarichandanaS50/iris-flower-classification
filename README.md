# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This is my first Data Science project built completely from scratch using *Python* and *Scikit-Learn*.  
It predicts the type of Iris flower based on petal and sepal measurements.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning.  
It includes 150 samples of iris flowers, each with 4 features:
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

The goal is to classify flowers into one of three species:
1. Setosa  
2. Versicolor  
3. Virginica

## âš™ Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)  
- JupyterLab  
- Joblib (for model saving)

---

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data visualization using Seaborn  
3. Train-test split and feature scaling  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression  
5. Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  
6. Model saved as .pkl for reuse

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- *Accuracy:* 100%  
- The model perfectly classifies all flower types.
